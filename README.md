# Fandango
Fandango is an in-development game engine and graphics technology. It currently only supports 2D and Windows, although Mac, Linux and 3D graphics are on their way. This is meant as a hobby project of mine, but pull requests are welcome.

## Installation

You will need to build the engine from source. To do this, start by cloning the repository with the flag --recursive
```
git clone https://github.com/lccatala/Fandango --recursive
```
Then run the script WindowsSetup.bat and open the Fandango solution file from Visual Studio 2019.

## Future Features

* Complete 2D Renderer (sprites, particles, UI...)
* Support for Mac, Linux, Android and iOS
* Native rendering support with DirectX, Metal and Vulkan
* Fully featured level editor app
* Scripted behavior and interaction
* Audio system
* Artificial intelligence
* Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine
* Procedural world generation
* Physically-based 3D Rendering
